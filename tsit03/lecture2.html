            <h2>Methods to Break Ciphers</h2>
            <p>
                There are numerous ways to break ciphers. You can:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Try all possible keys to find the one that decrypts. This is 
                        referred to as an exhaustive search.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use statistics of sorts. It can be statistics of the alphabet that
                        the language in question uses, digrams/trigrams , or words.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do calculations adjusted to the algorithm that is used to encrypt.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Will these methods always be successful? Probably now for all cases, some 
                techniques are better suited for certain cryptosystems and might require certain
                conditions in order to work. While exhaustive search will work eventually, it is
                more often than not computationally infeasible to finish in a reasonable time.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some main attack possibilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ciphertext only</strong>. A quite common case where the attacker
                        knows nothing more than the ciphertext itself (from interception perhaps).
                        In these cases one could try to use plaintext properties to get the key,
                        however this might not work for all ciphers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Known plaintext</strong>. The attacker might know both the plaintext
                        and the ciphertext which can allow for simple deduction of the key in some
                        ciphers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Chosen plaintext</strong>. Some ciphers have weak messages that can
                        reveal the key just by choosing a good plaintext. There are also cases of 
                        ciphers where one can use pairs of plaintext to reveal information about the
                        key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Chosen ciphertext</strong>. Much like a chosen plaintext attack the
                        attacker can reveal key information by choosing good ciphertext. The difference
                        is that the attacker now looks at the decryption process instead of encryption.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                From these types of attacks one can expect different results. In some cases the attacker
                might get a hold of the entire key, a <em>complete break</em>, which is the goal of
                the cryptanalysis. In some other cases the attacker might only achieve a partial break,
                revealing more plaintext than before. While it is certainly not as good as a complete
                break of the cipher, it might reveal useful information nontheless. Sometimes the attacker
                can find cryptograms that matches some plaintext which can be useful in authentication
                schemes. For example an attacker might find another message that gives the same RSA
                signature as the received message. How useful that message will be is hard to say though.

            <h2>Remaining Topics</h2>
            <p>
                The lecture goes into detail about how entropy and specifically <em>Shannon entropy</em>
                can be used to find information from an attacker's POV. There's also mentions about
                <em>guessing entropy</em> and how it can be useful for cases when Shannon entropy does
                not help. These topics are still to be covered. Read lectures for the information about
                why entropy can help and the complete math.
