            <h1>Lecture 3 - Stream Ciphers, Random Number Generators</h1>
            <h2>The One Time Pad (OTP) in Short</h2>
            <p>
                As discussed through the recent lectures, the only theoretically secure cipher
                that offers perfect secrecy is the OTP. However, OTP requires a <strong>truly random key</strong>, 
                equally long as the message we're trying to send. Another problem is that we need a 
                secure channel to transfer said key such that the recipient can decode the message. All
                of the mentioned requirements are problems that makes it more or less impossible to use OTP in practice.
            </p>
            <h2>A More Practical Approach</h2>
            <p>
                To still achieve good security one can opt for <strong>stream ciphers</strong>. In stream 
                ciphers we generate a pseudo random <em>key stream</em> from a given <em>seed</em> that is
                significantly shorter than the stream that is used to encrypt our message. To make strengthen
                stream ciphers against exhaustive search we make sure that the set of possible seeds that we 
                can use is substantially large; So large that the exhaustive search would take too long for it
                to be a viable attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stream ciphers can sometimes be viewed as weak, although this is not generally true. Stream
                ciphers are fast, they require no fixed block size for encryption and errors will not propagate
                through the encrypted message (which can happen in block ciphers). However, they lack any sort
                of message integrity check. Also stream ciphers must be used with care and be followed to the 
                letter. Any misuse and things can go south. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example of how the integrity of a message is not checked lets imagine a bank transfer of
                your salary. Imagine that the message, containing your salary amount, is encrypted as a stream
                cipher. Lets assume you intercept the bank transfer, and get a hold of the encrypted message.
                You happen to know at which position the salary is written in the bank transfer and with that
                knowledge you know which encrypted bits corresponds to the salary numbers in the plaintext message.
                While you can't read the plaintext, you can alter the ciphertext bits in that position, effectively
                changing the salary amount. Since no one checks the integrity of the message, no one will ever know
                that the amount was changed during the message transfer. 
            </p>
            <h2>Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)</h2>
            <p>
                For OTP and many other cryptosystems it is a requirement to have sequences of random bits in order to
                do encryption. One can find randomness just by examining nature, for instance thermal noise
                from a semiconductor resistor. The problem with natural randomness is partly that it is slow to sample
                from such sources. Moreover, it is difficult to assure that no one else is observing us in the process
                of sampling. So while we can't construct a truly random number generator, we can make sufficiently good 
                ones in software instead. Such generators are often called <strong>pseudo-random</strong> or short, PRNGs.
                Although they come with drawbacks. Since the sender and receiver must be able to generate the same key stream from
                the seed, the generator itself must be deterministic. Another drawback of real-world generators is
                that they must be finite, that is have a fixed number of states that it can produce. And being finite
                means that eventually that generator will wrap around and revisit a state it has already been in. After
                that, the internal states and output will repeat, making it possible to break the cipher.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An example of a PRNG is a <strong>linear congruential generator</strong> for instance found in the C
                library function <em>rand()</em>. Such a generator produces a sequence of numbers $x_1,x_2,...$ where
                $$x_n = ax_{n-1} + b \pmod{m}.$$ The initial seed that is given to this generator is $x_0$, and the 
                parameters $a$, $b$ and $m$ govern the relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this kind of pseudo-random number generator works for experimental purposes, it is not suitable
                to implement one in a cryptographic application. In the late 70's it was shown that this type of PRNG
                is highly predictable, even if the eavesdropper does not know about $a$, $b$ and $m$. In the early
                80's even polynomial congruential generators were broken. The problem seems to be that we need a PRNG
                that produces non-predictable bits to form a sequence. One way of doing so is with one-way functions, 
                which will be discussed more in coming lectures. For now let's shift (ha-ha) focus to another way of
                encrypting.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)</h2>
            <p>
                LSFRs is yet another way of doing encryption, this time using <em>linear recurrence</em> to produce a
                sequence of bits to use for encryption and decryption. They have been a "workhorse" for military 
                encryption for as long as electronics has existed. The main take-away from LFSRs is that they are
                fast (in hardware) and can produce a key with a large period using very little initial information. 
                It can be shown that given an initial vector of $m$ bits, a LFSR can produce a key with a period
                length of $2^{m} - 1$. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One disadvantage of linear feedback shift registers is that they are vulnerable to known plaintext 
                attacks. A sequence of length $ 2m $ is sufficient enough to recover the key for a length-$m$ LFSR.
                The <em>Berlekamp-Massey algorithm</em> can be used to find the key of a LFSR of length-$m$. 
            </p>

            <h2>Berlekamp-Massey algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                The following section will demonstrate how to find the shortest LFSR that gives the sequence only
                needing $2m$ bits. The example can also be found in the slides of lecture 3 as well as in the 
                course literature. Keep in mind that the example looks complicated, however it is really not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose that we have knowledge of a sequence of bits $011010111100010011010111$ that is the output
                of a LFSR 
                
                $$ X_{n+m} = c_0X_n + c_1X_{n+1} + ... + c_{m-1}X_{n+m-1}. $$
                
                We know nothing about the length $m$ and thus, we must try different lengths until we
                find the right one. We start with length $m=2$, since a length of 1 would produce a constant
                sequence. Trying with $m = 2$ gives us

                $$ 
                \left\{\begin{matrix}
                c_00 + c_11 = 1
                \\ 
                c_01 + c_11 = 0
                \end{matrix}\right.
                $$ 

                $$
                \begin{pmatrix}
                   0 & 1\\
                   1 & 1
                \end{pmatrix}

                \begin{pmatrix}
                    c_0 \\
                    c_1
                \end{pmatrix}
                = 
                \begin{pmatrix}
                    1 \\
                    0
                \end{pmatrix}
                $$

                $$ c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1$$

                $$ 01101{\color{Royalblue}1011011011011...} $$
            </p>
            <p>
                The first 5 bits in the sequence is correct, after that we have a recurring sequence $101$
                which isn't what were looking for. Therefore we'll try with $m=3$

                $$
                \begin{pmatrix}
                   0 & 1 & 1 \\
                   1 & 1 & 0 \\
                   1 & 0 & 1
                \end{pmatrix}

                \begin{pmatrix}
                    c_0 \\
                    c_1 \\
                    c_2
                \end{pmatrix}
                = 
                \begin{pmatrix}
                    0 \\
                    1 \\
                    0
                \end{pmatrix}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                Calculating the determinant for the square matrix (let's call it $A$) gives us $|A|=0$, 
                which means that the matrix either has zero solutions or more than one. We can skip $m=3$
                and try $m=4$ instead

                $$
                \begin{pmatrix}
                   {\color{Red}0} & {\color{Red}1} & {\color{Red}1} & {\color{Red}0} \\
                   1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
                   1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                   0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
                \end{pmatrix}

                \begin{pmatrix}
                    c_0 \\
                    c_1 \\
                    c_2 \\
                    c_3
                \end{pmatrix}
                = 
                \begin{pmatrix}
                 {\color{Red}1} \\
                 {\color{Red}0} \\
                 {\color{Red}1} \\
                 {\color{Red}1}
                \end{pmatrix}
                $$

                $$ c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1, c_2 = 0, c_3 = 0 $$
            </p>
            <p>
                (Fill in with an explanation for the red marked numbers in the calculation)
                For $m > 4$ the determinant for the square matrix is 0. This is a general indicator that we should stop
                and accept the last $m$ with non-zero determinant as the answer to the linear recurrence. It is relatively
                easy to confim that we found the correct length $m$ by calculating the remaining bits of the sequence using
                a LFSR with length $m$ and the comparing the sequence to the known one. Should it be that the sequences are
                not equal, we continue to search with increasing $m$.
            </p>

            <h3>LFSRs in Stream Ciphers</h3>
            <p>
                LFSRs are used in some stream ciphers, although they are constructed to be non-linearly through combinations of
                several LFSRs.  
            </p>
            <p>
                A well known stream cipher that uses LFSRs is the <em>A5/1 (GSM)</em> cipher found in old mobile telephone
                communication. It uses three LFSRs, only clocking the LFSRs that agree in the clock bit (marked orange in the
                lecture slides). The initial state is the only thing contrbuting to the key. A5/1 has been broken. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the A5/1 cipher, we have the A5/2 stream cipher, which is a weaker GSM. It uses four LFSRs and only clock LFSRs where the
                majority of clock bits agree. A5/2 was broken the same month it was published in 1999, and has been prohibited
                from implementation in mobiles since 2007 (A bit too late one could say).
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also the cipher KASUMI which is a modification of MISTY (done by SAGE). KASUMI is used in UMTS, GSM 
                (A5/3) and GPRS (GEA3). Unfortunately KASUMI be broken with a known plaintext attack. Adding insult
                to injury, it can be done with very modest computational resources. Important to note though is that the attack
                does not work on the designs used in UMTS, GSM and GPRS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bluetooth (E0) also uses LFSRs, specifically four of them with two 2-bit internal states. It exists attacks against
                bluetooth with a complexity of $2^{38}$.
            </p>
            <p>
                A popular stream cipher that uses LFSRs is the RC4 (ARCFOUR). It was broken in 2015 but was previously used in application
                such as WEP, WPA, BitTorrent, Opera Mini, RDP, PDF, Skype. RC4 used in WEP has a weakness in the 40/104-bit key
                that is concatenated with a 24-bit IV (nonce). The problem is that the concatenated bits are not large enough to avoid
                IV repetition. RC4 is also vulnerable to related-key attacks, like when using non-random keys or badly designed key 
                management (like in WEP).
            </p>
            <p>
                SNOW 3G is a stream cipher that uses only one LFSR in combination with a more complicated finite state machine. In contrast
                to the other ciphers mentioned in this subsection, SNOW 3G is still considered secure, and it is fast. It is part of the 
                3GPP standard.
