            <h1>Lecture 1 - Principles and History</h1>
            <p> 
                This lecture introduces course material, basic crypotlogy principles,
                and runs through some historical ciphers and cipher breakthroughs. As such, 
                notes from this lecture is brief and propbably not that important to follow up
                on before the exam.

                Cryptography traces back to the Greek words <em>kryptos</em>, meaning <em>hidden</em> 
                and <em>graphein</em> a verb for <em>to write</em>. Cryptography is used to hide 
                what we call <strong>plaintext</strong> by converting it into <strong>ciphertext</strong>.
                Some might also call ciphertext <em>cryptogram</em>. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When converting plaintext into ciphertext we use an encryption system like DES, AES, RSA etc.
                which all depend on a secret parameter we call the <em>key</em>. Parties that wish
                to communicate can use the same key, a <em>symmetric cryptosystem</em>. An example of such is 
                AES. They can also use different keys, also known as a asymmetric cryptosystem. RSA is one kind
                of asymmetric cryptosystem. It is known that symmetric systems are much faster than the
                asymmetric kind.

                A historical cipher that we know of is <em>Skytale</em>. It worked as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Wind a strip of leather (one letter wide) tight around a very specific sized stick</li>
                    <li>Write the message as normal across the stick</li>
                    <li>unwrap and send to the receiver who has the same kind of stick. They can then wind the 
                        leather strip once again and read the message.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                The cipher is a transposition cipher, meaning that the cipher uses only plaintext letters, 
                but places them in a different order. More commonly one would create a fixed size matrix and
                write the message inside the matrix one character per cell. Then just rearrange the columns.
                <br>
                While this cipher is easy to break (guess number of columns and then rearrange them) it served
                its purpose back in the day to give military orders on the battlefield. By the time the cipher was
                broken by the enemies, the order would've probably been carried out already.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Another well known cipher is the Caesar cipher. In its most basic form, each letter of the alphabet
                is exchanged with a letter <em>x</em> positions further on in the alphabet. The ciphertext alphabet
                is therefore just an offset x from the normal one.
                <br>
                This cipher is also easy to break, even by hand. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Vigenère is a cipher that uses the Caesar cipher but in a slightly different manner. For each plaintext
                letter a different Caesar cipher offset is used, and which one shall be used is determined by a key stream.
                <br>
                Vigenère comes in two forms; true Vigenère and normal Vigenère. The true Vigenère uses a key to start of the 
                key stream and then appends the so far encrypted plaintext to the stream to encrypt the rest of the plaintext.
                Normal Vigenère repeats the chosen key for the whole plaintext, making it the easier version to break.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Another cipher mentioned in the lecture is the simple substitution cipher. It is real simple, we build a set of
                unique crypto characters that each correspond to a plaintext character. Then we simply substitute the message's
                characters with its corresponding crypto character.
                <br>
                While the cipher is not as easy to break by hand as Caesar is with its simple offset, one can use language
                statistics to break it. Since every crypto letter occurs as often as its plaintext counterpart, one can examine the 
                letter distribution of both the language of the plaintext message and the crypto letter set. Then it is fairly easy to
                make out which crypto letter corresponds to which plaintext letter.

            <br>

                The last cipher simple cipher covered in the lecture is the playfair cipher which is a form of substitution
                cipher. It encrypts digrams of the plaintext and does so with a 5x5 matrix. Playfair requires you to 
                (as all ciphers mostly do) chose a key and then fill the first cells with that key. After that fill the rest of
                the matrix with the remaining letters of the alphabet. After that encryption is done according to a set of rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the letters of the digram appear in the same column, each letter is encrypted to the one below it. 
                        Should the plaintext letter be in the bottom row, the encrypted letter is the one at the top (it wraps around).
                    </li>
                    <li>If letters appear in the same row, the letter to the right of the plaintext letter is chosen for
                        encryption. Should the letter be at the right side of the matrix, the leftmost letter is used for encryption.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If letters in the digram adhear to non of the former rules, that is they are in different columns and rows, then
                        form a "rectangle" in the matrix with plaintext letters as "corners". The other two corners correspond to 
                        the letters for encryption. Note that plaintext and encyption letters are on the same row, thus we move sideways
                        to find the letter we want to encrypt to.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The lecture also talks in more detail about the enigma cipher used during world war II. Enigma uses the same principle as
                Vigenère does. The key that is used is decided by which ones of the rotors are used and what their starting position should be.
                It also uses a plugboard to to tell which letter should be exchanged. The machine supported an enourmous amount of combinations
                making it difficult to break. Polish cryptologists were the first ones to break the enigma, and the techniques was passed onto the
                British only two months before Germany invaded Poland. The fact that the British hade broken the enigma cipher was kept secret for
                almost 30 years after the war had ended.
